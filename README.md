## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4
- Javascript

### What I learned

This is my first ever commerce related project and I spent a good amount of time thinking before implementing. I got to make a functioning cart, popovers, increment and decrement buttons etc. 

### Continued development

This project is a single page commerce website with just one item. I would love to work on a multi-page commerce project with numerous items for sale in the nearest future. The idea is to get comfortable with projects of this nature.
